Hello!
There were a few things that I wanted to mention.

1. I did what was recommended and used the book to determine how to solve the problem.
2. I solved the math error that Alberto said was in the text.
3. I checked, double checked, and triple checked my code. From what I can see, everything should work,
but the measurements aren't exact (Even though they should be, they just aren't because there is some sort of 
error in the book's programming)
4. I tried to contact Ash, but he was unavailable for the entire night, so I had no one to help me solve the problem.
